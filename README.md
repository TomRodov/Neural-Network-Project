# Neural-Network-Project

This repository contains a data science project focused on constructing a model which can can predict a books genre based on its text description, the dataset used was from the website goodreads, in which a dataset of the top 10000 most popular books were used. Some preprocessing and cleaning were required as the text length varied wildely and also contained books with languages other than english. The model contains Long Short-Term Memory layers, embedding, dropout and dense layers in order to improve performance. In the future I am planning on putting different weights on certain words as many descriptions share the same common words such as "Of" "And" "When" and so on. Additionaly I would also like to try to remove them completely to see the effect on the model.
